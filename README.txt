I am unsure of the licensing status of this program, but I do know that I wrote the entire
thing myself and never signed any paperwork giving up my right to it. It was moving in the
direction of a hosting service for other organizations to use, but last I checked it had
been replaced.

This was the core software running the day-to-day operations at Computer Answers, a
computer repair chain. I was tasked with duplicating the functionality of what they were
already using and adding a few things. The project ended up being much more than that, and
had I known the scope from the beginning, I probably would have done a much better job.

Released as-is, no warranty, etc.
